# Driftless

Driftless is the workspace where you and your team work **with** your agents — and the work becomes the team's living context: **anchored** (it knows which code/system it governs), **governed** (agents propose; merging into Knowledge is an owner/admin act), and **drift-aware** (it knows when it stopped being true). It maintains itself as a by-product of working, not like a wiki you tend.

Two planes on one spine:
- **Knowledge — Topics**: the durable *why* (decisions, gotchas, invariants). A **Note** is a hint; merging it into **Knowledge** (the team's source of truth) is an owner/admin act — you can run the merge yourself, but only when an owner/admin explicitly asks.
- **Operational — Collections & Records**: the CRMs, trackers, pipelines and analyses your agent runs. **Comments** annotate either.

You **read** the team's context before you touch an area, and **write** one clean note after you learn. Cloud is the source of truth — the team owns it, not you.

It is a **vault**, not a filing ceremony. Most of what you write stays a Note — that's healthy and expected. A few notes become **Knowledge** (merged in on an owner/admin's say-so) — the cross-cutting truths the whole team relies on. There is no approval gate you must clear; **a note is first-class and the agent reads it.** Because there's no gate, *quality is enforced at write time* — by the six rules below. That discipline is the whole product: a clean vault is useful, a messy one rots.

## The two moves

1. **Read before you work.** Before touching a module, pull what the team already knows for that area. Drifted topics carry a freshness badge so you know what changed while you were gone.
2. **Write one clean note after you learn.** When you hit a durable gotcha, decision, or invariant, leave exactly one clean note. Don't chase approval — leave something good.

## Default behavior for Driftless work

When the user invokes Driftless, asks about workspace context, or asks you to operate any Driftless plane, do not guess. Use the routing table first. If the request involves a surface you do not clearly know how to operate — Topics/Knowledge, Notes, Projects, Collections/Records, Entities, Broker/integrations, workspaces, areas, tags, hooks, sync, or pre-commit refresh — read this skill completely before acting, then follow referenced files only as needed.

Do not ask the user to "load the Driftless skill." In repos with `.driftless/`, `@.driftless/skill.md` is the local operational manual and AGENTS.md points to it. Load it yourself when the task is Driftless-specific or when the command surface is uncertain.

## Deciding your first move (the routing table)

Pick the FIRST call by what you have in hand. This is the spine — detailed flows live in the references.

| Situation | First move |
|---|---|
| You know the **files** you'll edit | `context get --files "a.ts,b.ts"` (drift shows inline) → details: `references/retrieve.md` |
| You have a **task** but no slug yet | `driftless_context_retrieve { task, files }` (MCP) / `POST /topics/retrieve` — ranked, drifted-first, BRIEF bodies. **Start here when context is unknown.** |
| You know the **topic slug** | `context get <slug>` (full body) |
| Searching by **concept** | `context search <kw>` → `context get <slug>` |
| Working a **project board** | `project card next <pid>` → load `context_bundle` → work → validate → mark done |
| Acting on a **collection record** | `driftless_collection action:'retrieve' id:<cid>` (records + the criterion to read FIRST) → details: `references/retrieve.md` |
| Operating a **connected integration** | `broker operations <provider>` → `broker invoke <provider> <op>`. **Operation not listed? STOP + report — never script it.** → details: `references/broker.md` |
| You **learned something durable** | `context add/update <slug> --area <domain> ...` (the six rules) |
| About to **commit / push** | `context get --diff` (add `--mark` to flag matched topics drifted) |
| Context looks **untrustworthy** | `context doctor` |

**Retrieve-first.** When you don't yet know which topic governs the area, `driftless_context_retrieve` is the one call that composes search + match-files + list and ranks them — don't hand-chain `search → list → get`. It returns BRIEF bodies (the durable *why*, not full `content`); follow up with `context get <slug>` for the one full body you actually need (the view tiers are `summary` / `brief` / `full` — full is always an opt-in).

**Integration scripting is off-limits.** A normal agent NEVER authors or deploys an integration script (a Nango action). It only OPERATES connections that already exist (the broker). Connecting a provider is human-led SETUP. If a broker operation you need doesn't exist, report the missing capability — see Broker & integrations below.

## CRITICAL: the six rules every write follows

These are not advice — they are the gate. Hold them on every `add` / `update` (the CLI and MCP nudge you, but the discipline is yours).

- **A. One concept per note.** Atomic. If you're tempted to cover two things, write two notes.
- **B. Always file into an area** (`--area <name|id>`). Run `driftless area list` to see the domains (it's the only place the area *name* is shown — don't guess); pick one before you write, or `driftless area add "<name>"` if none fits. Never leave a note in *Unassigned* — that's where vaults rot.
- **C. Anchor narrow** (`--pattern`, ~5–40 files, never `src/**`). For non-code memory, anchor the doc/api/system it's about. A loose anchor causes false drift and leaks the note into work it has nothing to say about.
- **D. Trust is a signal, not a gate.** Knowledge (`reviewed`) = team truth; a Note = a hint. Both reach the agent, weighted. Write to leave a *good note*, not to get something approved.
- **E. Rewrite to consolidate; append to add.** Adding a new standalone fact → append. Correcting or overlapping what's there → rewrite the field coherently. Never stack a wall.
- **F. Content is the durable *why*, not a changelog.** Decisions, invariants, gotchas a future code change would contradict. No dates, "shipped", PR/commit refs, or status — that lives in git. A changelog-shaped field is the #1 cause of slop.

The litmus for whether something deserves a note at all: **would a future code change meaningfully contradict it?** If yes, it's durable. If it just restates the code or is a transient value, it's not a topic.

## Reading — before you work

```bash
# Have a task but no slug? Retrieve is the one ranked call (composes search + match-files + list).
#   MCP:  driftless_context_retrieve { task: "add idempotency to the Stripe webhook", files: ["src/billing/webhooks/*"] }
#   API:  POST /topics/retrieve   (brief bodies by default; pass view:"full" for whole bodies)
driftless context get <slug>                  # if you know the slug (full body)
driftless context search <keyword>            # ranked; narrow with more terms, "quotes", OR, -negation
driftless context get --files "src/billing/billing.service.ts,src/billing/refunds/*"   # match by path
driftless context list --area billing         # browse a domain
```

Read the full topic: `what` / `how` / `where` / `gotchas` / `decisions` / `invariants` / `history`. **Returning after time away?** Check `history` and the freshness badge before assuming your old understanding holds. Full retrieve flow (when to use which, the brief→full pattern): `references/retrieve.md`.

No topic matches the file you're about to edit? Read the code, then leave a note (don't skip it — the absence of a topic is a gap to close, not permission to assume).

> Auto-pull (Claude Code): `install-skill` wires a PreToolUse hook that injects the team's **Knowledge** for a file before you edit it — inert until a workspace admin enables it. Details in `references/workflow.md`.

## Writing — after you learn

Distill the durable insight, then `add` (no topic yet) or `update` (one exists). Batch every related change into ONE call — each write bumps version and writes a history event.

```bash
# New area — write the markdown body yourself (templates in .driftless/assets/templates/)
driftless context add refund-flow --title "Refunds" \
  --what "Refund issuance and its reconciliation rules." \
  --content @doc.md \
  --area billing \
  --pattern "src/billing/refunds/**"

# Existing topic — append new standalone facts atomically
driftless context update billing-flow \
  --gotcha "Stripe webhooks deliver out-of-order — idempotency-key required" \
  --decision "Async handler chosen over sync to absorb retry storms" \
  --invariant "Webhook handlers must be idempotent" \
  --add-pattern "src/billing/webhooks/**"

# Spot a wall (redundancy / contradiction / changelog)? Rewrite the field coherently — don't append a fix
driftless context get billing-flow                              # pull fresh first
driftless context update billing-flow --decisions "<one coherent decision replacing the overlapping ones>"
```

`--what` = one tight sentence (the list summary). `--content` = the real explanation as markdown (the body IS the topic). `--how` = a SHORT note on the mechanism (1–3 sentences, never a pasted doc). The structured flags (`--gotcha`/`--decision`/`--invariant`/`--check`) are optional highlights surfaced to the machine — never invent an empty one.

**Pattern validation runs at write time** — every glob is matched against your checkout. `⚠ over-broad anchor` (>100 files) means split into narrower topics; a 0-match glob is blocked (it'd be a zombie on day one). Trust it.

**Never persist a secret** — credential-shaped writes are blocked client- and server-side (`--allow-secrets` only for a genuine false positive).

## Naming (get these three right — they're constantly confused)

- **slug** — stable kebab-case id, specific. e.g. `mcp-architecture`.
- **`--title`** — short human display name, **one or two words** like a diagram node (`MCP`, `Billing`). Not a sentence. Always set it.
- **`--what` / `--content`** — the explanation. Never put the explanation in the title.

## Anchoring (rule C, in depth)

An anchor is a **contract**: it declares the one boundary a topic governs. Drift fires only when that boundary changes; retrieval delivers the topic only to work inside it.

| Match count | Verdict |
|---|---|
| 5–40 | Healthy |
| 41–99 | Wide — verify it's truly one concept |
| 100+ | Trap — split it |

A whole domain is **not** a topic — it's a hub with per-service spokes (`api-backend` as a light hub, `billing-service --pattern "apps/api/billing/**"` as a spoke), connected by relations. If you reach for `src/**`, the answer is more topics, not a wider glob. Full discipline in `references/topic-anatomy.md`.

## Linking

- **`[[slug]]` mention** — inline in any free-text field; a weak untyped backlink. Use when a gotcha/decision only makes sense given another topic.
- **`--rel <type>:<slug>`** — a strong typed edge (both ends must exist): `relates_to`, `depends_on`, `supersedes`, `blocks`, `implements`, `documents`, `risk_for`. Use when the relationship itself is the fact.

Both render in the graph (`context graph`). Promote a mention to `--rel` when it's a real dependency.

## Tags (optional, transversal)

A tag is a cross-cut that groups topics across *different* subjects (`security`, `performance`, `tech-debt`) — **not** the topic's subject (don't tag `billing` on a billing topic) and **not** its home (that's the area). Most notes need zero or one. Reuse the registry (`driftless tags`) before coining one.

## Governance (the footnote — most notes stay notes)

One primitive, one trust axis: **Note → Knowledge**.

- **Note** — what you write. Private by default; share it to the workspace and it's *Up for review*. Untouched notes auto-archive ~14d (recoverable). The agent reads notes as **hints**.
- **Knowledge** (`reviewed`) — the team's source of truth, *the notes merged in*. Merging is an **owner/admin** act: you can run the merge (`context approve`) yourself, but **only when an owner/admin explicitly asks** — never on your own initiative, and never if you lack that authority (an ownerless key or a non-owner is refused). The agent reads Knowledge as **truth**.

```bash
driftless context propose <slug>     # Note → Up for review
driftless context approve <slug>     # merge into Knowledge — owner/admin only; run it only when explicitly asked
driftless context pr <slug> --open --summary "why" --content @new.md   # Suggested edit to existing Knowledge
```

You don't need to push notes toward Knowledge — that promotion is for the few cross-cutting truths the team relies on. Just leave clean notes (the six rules). Don't merge unprompted: propose, and merge only when an owner/admin tells you to. To change existing Knowledge, open a Suggested edit — never clobber it.

## Setup (first time)

```bash
driftless login                # or: --key <api-key>
driftless install-skill        # writes CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .driftless/
driftless doctor               # verify auth/connectivity/repo link
```

Then just work and leave clean notes. Don't seed a generic placeholder topic — it documents nothing and rots. Your first note should be about something REAL you'd tell a new teammate.

## Working through a project — the agent loop

A project is a board of cards. Each card is one unit of work with an optional `acceptance` criterion and `validate` command. The loop has four steps — repeat until `project_done` is true:

```bash
# 1. Get the next actionable card + its context bundle (one call, no extra round-trip)
driftless project card next <project-id>
# MCP: driftless_project_card action:'next' project_id:'<id>'
# Returns: { card, context_bundle, project_done }
```

```bash
# 2. Work the card. Load the context_bundle first — it carries the team's recorded
#    memory for that card's area so you don't re-derive what the team already knows.
```

```bash
# 3. Validate — run the card's `validate` command if present. Non-zero = stop-and-fix.
#    Check `acceptance` to confirm the outcome matches the definition of done.
```

```bash
# 4. Write-back and mark done
driftless context update <slug> --gotcha "..."   # persist anything durable you learned
driftless project card status <project-id> <card-id> done
# MCP: driftless_project_card action:'set' card_id:'<id>' status:'done'
#      driftless_project_card action:'next' project_id:'<id>'  ← next iteration
```

**Live-session coordination (Active Work):** when several agents share a repo+branch, bracket a card's execution: `driftless work start --project <pid> --card <cid> --objective "..."` runs a deterministic preflight (CONFLICT = the card is already being executed elsewhere, pick another; AWARENESS = a live session overlaps your files/topics — coordinate) and a `todo` card moves to `in_progress`. Hooks stream observed files + heartbeats; ALWAYS close with `driftless work finish --outcome ... [--card-status review|done|blocked|in_progress]` or `driftless work abandon` — the card moves only where you explicitly ask, and an unclosed session expires on its own 15 min after the last heartbeat. MCP: the `driftless_work` tool, same actions.

**Dep-gating:** a `todo` card with unmet deps never appears in `next` — it only becomes "ready" once all cards in its `depends_on` list are `done`. When no cards are ready and none are in-flight, `project_done` is true.

**Mid-loop write-back:** a gotcha you hit *while* working a card → `driftless note add --content "..." --project <pid> --card <card-id>`. It attaches to that card, rides its `next` context_bundle, and is synthesized into a draft topic when the project closes — so a learning from card 3 is never lost waiting for the end.

**Stop-and-fix:** if `validate` exits non-zero, do NOT mark the card done. Fix the failure, then re-validate. The loop halts here until the card is genuinely done.

**Blocked:** if you cannot proceed without a human decision, set the card to `blocked`:
```bash
driftless project card status <project-id> <card-id> blocked
# MCP: driftless_project_card action:'set' card_id:'<id>' status:'blocked'
```

## Pre-commit / pre-push

```bash
driftless context get --diff           # topics matching your local diff; drifted ones show a badge
driftless context get --diff --mark    # …and flag them drifted from local git (no GitHub App needed)
```

If a topic your change touched is stale, refresh it before pushing. `--mark` is opt-in — plain `--diff` only displays.

**Cite what you used.** When committing work that drew on team context, add one commit trailer per topic you relied on — `Context-Used: <slug>@v<N>` (the version comes from the context you read) — so the PR carries its sources.

## Comments — annotate without editing

A **comment** is a thin annotation that points AT a spine object (a topic/record) or a project card — never a topic itself (no version, drift, or governance; its text stays out of the topic body, rule F). Author is human or agent. It resolves into an edit: `open → resolved → wont_fix`. The killer placement is the **Note→Knowledge gate** — leave precise, field-level feedback at review time instead of a coarse approve/reject.

```bash
driftless context comment add <topic-slug> --body "…" [--field decisions]   # or --card/--record <uuid>
driftless context comment list <topic-slug> [--status open]                 # the reviewer's view
driftless context comment resolve <id> [--wont-fix]   ·   reopen <id>
```

## Collections — the operational substrate

A **Collection** is a configured table (`record_schema` + `views` + lifecycle + `criterion_rel_slugs`); a **Record** is one typed row. Each use case — CRM, bug tracker, support tickets, content calendar — is a *configured Collection, not new code*. Three archetypes: **pipeline** (records flow by status), **analysis** (record anchored to a drifting source), **content** (a record with a draft→published lifecycle). A record reads the team's Knowledge via `criterion_rel_slugs` before the work happens (the seam). Collections are a **separate primitive from Projects** (the agent loop) — they coexist.

**Before working a record, read its criterion.** The `retrieve` action delivers both halves of the seam in ONE call — the relevant records AND the criterion Knowledge to apply first:

```bash
# MCP: driftless_collection action:'retrieve' id:'<collection-id>'  →  { records, nextCursor, criterion, criterion_missing }
#   read the criterion, then:  driftless_collection_record action:'update' collection_id:'<id>' record_id:'<id>' fields:{...}
# action:'context' returns just the criterion (no records).
```

When operating from a terminal/CLI instead of MCP, use the CLI surface directly:

```bash
driftless collection list --status active --json
driftless collection get <collection-id> --json
driftless collection records <collection-id> [--status <stage>] --json
driftless collection record update <collection-id> <record-id> --status <stage> --json
driftless collection record update <collection-id> <record-id> --fields '<json>' --json
```

If the user mentions a pipeline, hiring, candidates, bugs, CRM, records, or collection data, start with `driftless collection list --status active --json`, find the named Collection, inspect it with `get`, then list/update records. For the recruiting pipeline, look for the active Collection named `Hiring`. Do not ask the user to load the Driftless skill before doing this; use the CLI/MCP surface already available.

Full surface in `references/commands.md` (`driftless collection …`); the records+criterion flow in `references/retrieve.md`.

## Broker & integrations — operate, never script

**Two separate concerns, kept apart on purpose:**

- **Integration SETUP** — *connecting/configuring* a provider. A privileged, **human-led** flow: the dashboard (Settings → Connections) or `driftless integration connect <provider>` → `confirm`. The broker NEVER connects, disconnects, or configures a provider.
- **Broker EXECUTION** — *operating* a connection that already exists. This is the agent's lane:

```bash
driftless broker operations <provider>                      # the named operations this connection can do
driftless broker invoke <provider> <operation> --input '{...}'   # run one (inline + audited)
driftless broker records <provider> --model <m>             # read a synced model's records (delta-aware)
```

Credentials resolve server-side (they never reach you); every call is audited. Operations are served from materialized metadata — `--refresh` re-pulls from Nango.

**The no-scripting rule (do NOT cross this line).** A normal agent never authors or deploys an integration script (a Nango action) — that is a third, human-only lane. If the operation you need is **not** in `broker operations <provider>`, **STOP and report the missing capability** to the human; do not write a script to fill the gap. Full lifecycle in `references/broker.md`.

## Health

`driftless context doctor` audits the vault itself (stale / orphaned / zombie / draft / docs_pending / repo_leak / unassigned / duplicates). Run it if retrieval looks wrong or before relying heavily on the layer; consolidate flagged duplicates with `driftless context merge <src> --into <dst>`.
