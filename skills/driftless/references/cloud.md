# Driftless Cloud Architecture

## What Cloud Stores

Driftless Cloud is the source of truth for the team's durable context. It is not local session memory. It stores topics, anchors, relations, repo links, and audit history so humans and agents can retrieve the right context before touching files.

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| **Workspaces** | One per organization or team |
| **Repos** | Connected repositories per workspace |
| **Topics** | Durable context: what, how, gotchas, decisions, invariants, checks |
| **Topic Anchors** | `patterns`, `where_files`, and `where_repos` that connect topics to files/repos |
| **Topic Relations** | Typed edges between topics: depends_on, relates_to, supersedes, blocks, implements, documents, risk_for |
| **Topic Activity** | History of topic changes and file drift signals |
| **Integrations** | Governed external-system connections |
| **API Keys** | Per-workspace authentication keys for CLI/agents |

Cloud stores topic text and metadata. It does not need source-code bodies to deliver context.

## How Cloud Stays Updated

### 1. Topic Writes

Humans and agents create and update topics:

```bash
driftless context add <slug> --what "..." --how "..." --pattern "src/auth/**"
driftless context update <slug> --gotcha "..." --decision "..."
```

This is the primary growth path. If a session reveals durable knowledge, append it to the matching topic before finishing.

### 2. Anchors

Anchors make topics show up at the moment of work:

- `patterns` match repository-relative globs.
- `where_files` match explicit files.
- `where_repos` records which repos use a topic.

The CLI validates patterns against the local checkout before writing. A zero-match pattern is blocked; an over-broad pattern is warned.

### 3. Local checkout context

The CLI resolves the current repository identity and matches local file changes against topic anchors. `driftless context get --diff` retrieves the context touched by the current work; `--mark` explicitly persists drift when needed. Source code stays local.

### 4. Agent Refresh

Agents use:

```bash
driftless sync
driftless context get --files "src/path/file.ts"
driftless context get --diff
```

`sync` pulls drift and pending topic suggestions. `context get --files` retrieves topic context before editing. `context get --diff` retrieves topics touched by local uncommitted changes before finishing.

## Auth Model

| Surface | Auth Method | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | Clerk session + organization | Browser management |
| CLI | `X-API-Key` | Agents, scripts, local dev |
| MCP | OAuth bearer or API key | ChatGPT/Claude/local MCP clients |
| Provider webhooks | Signed provider payload | Connected commercial systems |

## Multi-Tenancy

Each workspace is isolated:

- Separate repos
- Separate topics
- Separate topic relations
- Separate API keys
- Separate integrations

One organization maps to one Driftless workspace.

## Tech Stack

- **API**: NestJS + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Auth**: Clerk organizations + encrypted API keys + OAuth for MCP
- **CLI**: Node.js, published via npm
- **Dashboard**: React + Vite
- **MCP**: protocol adapter that calls the REST API
- **Infra**: Render, Vercel, Supabase
